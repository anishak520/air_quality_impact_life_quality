# Air Quality's Effect on Quality of Life
This project investigates the relationship between air quality around the world and its impact on asthma prevalence and other parameters to describe quality of life.

## Data Sources

This project relies on various datasets sourced from reputable organizations and platforms to analyze the impact of air quality on asthma prevalence and quality of life indicators worldwide. The data sources used in this analysis include:

- **Air Quality Data**: Historical air quality data, obtained from [World Air Quality Index (WAQI)](https://waqi.info/). This data is organized in the `AirQuality` directory and includes multiple CSV files that document air quality levels across various global regions.

- **Asthma Prevalence**: Data on asthma prevalence by country, retrieved from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/asthma-prevalence). This dataset is available as `Asthma Prevalence By Country.csv` and provides insights into asthma rates across different countries.

- **Annual Asthma Hospitalizations (USA)**: State-level asthma hospitalization data for the USA from 2015-2021, sourced from the [Environmental Public Health Tracking Network (CDC)](https://ephtracking.cdc.gov/). This dataset is available in `Annual Asthma Hospitalizations (per year and state in USA. 2015-2021).csv`.

- **County-Level Hospital Admissions (USA)**: Hospital admissions data by county in the USA, obtained from the [CDC's Environmental Public Health Tracking Network](https://ephtracking.cdc.gov/). This file, `USA_County_Hospital_Admissions.csv`, provides localized data on hospital admissions that may relate to asthma and other respiratory conditions.

- **State-Level Hospital Admissions (USA)**: State-level hospital admissions data for the USA, also provided by the [CDC's Environmental Public Health Tracking Network](https://ephtracking.cdc.gov/). This dataset, `USA_States_Hospital_Admissions.csv`, includes a broader view of admissions for conditions potentially influenced by air quality.

- **World Happiness Reports**: Annual happiness data from 2015 to 2019, gathered from the [World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/data/). These reports provide data across a range of countries, indicating overall happiness and factors contributing to quality of life. Files are available for each year, named as `Happiness 2015.csv`, `Happiness 2016.csv`, `Happiness 2017.csv`, `Happiness 2018.csv`, and `Happiness 2019.csv`.

- **Life Expectancy Data**: Global life expectancy data, sourced from the [World Development Indicators](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators) provided by the World Bank. This dataset is available in `World Life Expectancy.csv` and provides a perspective on life expectancy that may correlate with environmental and health factors.
